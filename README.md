 # General Information
-As per given scenario 
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

# What is the dataset that is being used?
Dataset is largeger in size and are jpg image so it is not available here you can download data set from this link [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xLfSQUGDl8ezNNbUkpuHOYvSpTyxVhCs/view?usp=sharing).

## Conclusions
#Conclusion 1 from the analysis
Model is still overfitting, Overfitting in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a common problem that occurs when the model is too complex for the problem it is trying to solve. This can be resolved by tuning the hyperparameters of the model and ensuring that the data is divided into well-proportioned sets. Here are some ways to treat overfitting in CNNs:

Reduce the complexity of the model: This can be done by removing certain layers or decreasing the number of neurons (filters in CNN). Use regularization: Regularization can be used on the weights of the model to prevent overfitting. Split the data: Splitting the data into training, validation, and testing datasets can help fine-tune the model until youâ€™re satisfied with its performance.
